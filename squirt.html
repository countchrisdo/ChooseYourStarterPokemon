        <p><b><i>Squirtle</i></b> is a small Pokémon that resembles a light blue turtle. While it typically walks on its two short legs, it has been shown to run on all fours in <i>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</i>. It has large eyes and a slightly hooked upper lip. Each of its hands and feet has three pointed digits. The end of its long tail curls inward. Its body is encased by a tough shell that forms and hardens after birth. This shell is brown on the top, pale yellow on the bottom, and has a thick white ridge between the two halves.</p>

        
        
        <p><p><b><i>Squirtle's</i></b> shell is a useful tool. It can withdraw into the shell for protection or for sleeping, and its grooved, rounded shape helps to reduce water resistance when this Pokémon swims. <p><b><i>Squirtle</i></b> can spray foamy water from its mouth with great accuracy. In the past, Skull Bash was its signature move. <p><b><i>Squirtle</i></b> is scarce in the wild, although it can be found around small ponds and lakes. The anime has shown that it can be found living on secluded islands with other members of its evolutionary line.  </p> 
        
        <h3>Battle Overview</h3>
        
        <p><p><b><i>Squirtle's</i></b> diverse movepool, including support moves such as Fake Out and Rapid Spin, makes it seem appealing, but its lackluster stats hold it back from ever being useful in Little Cup. All of its possible sets are outclassed by other, better Water-types such as Staryu and Corphish, with any niches it has over these Pokemon being small or insignificant. <p><b><i>Squirtle</i></b> is a pretty terrible Pokemon in general and doesn't fit on nearly any team.</p>
        
        <p><p><b><i>Squirtle</i></b> has no recovery, so it's easily worn down. You can avoid this by only switching in when necessary. The most important times to switch Squirtle in are when you need to clear entry hazards or revenge kill with priority. Additionally, using Fake Out on a burned or poisoned target allows for more free damage.</p>
     
        <h3>Pokédex Entry Highlights!</h3>
        <ul> 
         <li>After birth, its back swells and hardens into a shell. Powerfully sprays foam from its mouth.</li>
         <li>Its shell is not just for protection. Its rounded shape and the grooves on its surface minimize resistance in water, enabling Squirtle to swim at high speeds.</li>
        </ul>
