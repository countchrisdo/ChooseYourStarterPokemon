        <p><b><i>Bulbasaur</i></b> is a small, quadruped <i>Pokémon</i> that has turquoise skin with darker teal patches. It has red eyes with white pupils and scleras. It also has pointed, ear-like structures on top of its head. Its snout is short and blunt, and it has a wide mouth. A pair of small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On its back is a green plant bulb, which is grown from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb provides it with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within.</p>

        
        
        <p>As mentioned in the anime, starter <i>Pokémon</i> are raised by Breeders to be distributed to new Trainers. Having been domesticated from birth, <b><i>Bulbasaur</i></b> is regarded as both a rare and well-behaved Pokémon. It is known to be extremely loyal, even after long-term abandonment. Bulbasaur has also shown itself to be an excellent caretaker, even having a special technique called the "Bulba-by." To perform this technique, Bulbasaur uses its vines to pick up a young Pokémon and soothingly rocks it in the air.</p>
            
        <p>It is found in grasslands and forests throughout the Kanto region. However, due to <b><i>Bulbasaur's</i></b> status as starter Pokémon, it is hard to come by in the wild and generally found under the ownership of a Trainer. It has been observed that a <b><i>Bulbasaur's</i></b> bulb will flash blue when it is ready to evolve. If it does not want to evolve, it struggles to resist the transformation. Many <b><i>Bulbasaur</i></b> gather every year in a hidden garden in Kanto to evolve into Ivysaur in a ceremony led by a <b><i>Venusuar</i></b>. </p>
        
        <h3>Battle Overview</h3>
        
        <p><b><i>Bulbasaur</i></b> is a potent sweeper in the LC metagame, as Z-Celebrate allows it to clean mid- or late-game and sweep unprepared teams with ease. Additionally, its Z-Celebrate-boosted bulk and access to Sleep Powder allow it to take some hits from strong Pokemon or immobilize them after setting up, since its good defensive typing gives it some key resistances, such as Fighting, Fairy, and Water. Unfortunately, <b><i>Bulbasaur</i></b> is frail and weak without the Z-Celebrate boosts, and it lacks setup opportunities against most of the Pokemon in the metagame since it is weak to common types such as Psychic and Flying. Bulbasaur also has a bad movepool and has to rely on Hidden Power Fire to do significant damage to Steel- and Poison-types, even with a Z-Celebrate boost, which can only be obtained once. Bulbasaur is also outsped by common Choice Scarf users such as Doduo and Rufflet. Bulbasaur also faces competition with Pumpkaboo-S, as both can use Z-Moves to boost all of their stats, and Z-Trick-or-Treat is obviously more useful than Z-Celebrate.</p>
        
        <p><b><i>Bulbasaur</i></b> is best used as a late-game sweeper or as a cleaner, so try to find setup opportunities against passive or slower Pokemon, such as <i>Spritzee, Snubbull, and Timburr</i>, by immobilizing them with Sleep Powder if <b><i>Bulbasaur</i></b> uses it on its set. Avoid setting up when your opponent has Pokemon that will eventually stop <b><i>Bulbasaur</i></b>, such as Steel-types and revenge killers. When playing against Pokemon that can check Bulbasaur effectively after a boost, use Sleep Powder to shut them down, but remember that Bulbasaur should stay healthy before it sets up. This includes avoiding status such as paralysis. Lastly, remove phazers such as Mareanie before setting up, as Bulbasaur is completely useless without the boosts provided by Z-Celebrate.</p>

         <li>It can go for days without eating a single morsel. In the bulb on its back, it stores energy.</li>
         <li>A strange seed was planted on its back at birth. The plant sprouts and grows with this Pokémon.</li>
         <li><b><i>Bulbasaur</i></b> can be seen napping in bright sunlight. There is a seed on its back. By soaking up the sun's rays, the seed grows progressively larger.</li>
